***
This is a Github Repository for Reinforcement Learning agents.
These are programmed by:
* Torsten Foehr
* Moritz Christ
* August Berger

They comprise the State of the art Agents:
* SAC [Soft-Actor-Critic](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1801.01290)
* TD3 [Twin Delayed DDPG 3](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1802.09477)
* DDQN [Double Doueling QNetworks](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1509.06461)

  All of the algorithms are programmed for the Contest at the Reinforcement class
  at the Universty of TÃ¼bingen in the Sommersemester of 2023.
