# RL Agents
***
This is a Github Repository for Reinforcement Learning agents.
These are programmed by:
* Torsten Foehr
* Moritz Christ
* August Berger

They comprise the State of the art Agents:
* SAC [Soft-Actor-Critic](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1801.01290)
* TD3 [Twin Delayed DDPG 3](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1802.09477)
* DDQN [Double Doueling QNetworks](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1509.06461)

All of the algorithms are programmed for the Contest at the Reinforcement class
at the *University of TÃ¼bingen* in the Sommersemester of 2023.

Change for all Networks come from the [Rainbow Paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1710.02298).

We hope to achieve good results at a laser-hockey playground.
Therefore our agent has to qualify by beating the baseline method in a match.
After that it will play against multiple different other agents from the course.

### Folderstructure
Our code is seperated by the **Basic**s folder here multiple functions can be found,
that were given in the exercises of the course.
The folders with an **agents name** comprise files for the agent and
a *main* file to prove that the agent is working we evaluated him on the *LunarLanderEnvironment*.
Not yet implemented but soon coming, is the folder **Playground**, comprising the environment of the *Laser-hockey*.
And methods to let two agents combat each other.
